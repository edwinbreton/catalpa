            <h3>Vision</h3>
            <p>
                The vision of Milburn T. Maupin Elementary: A Catalpa Model is to educate the child rhythmically and respectfully by using methods inspired by Waldorf tradition.  We strive to meet the academic needs of each unique child through a balance of art, music, drama, movement, and experiences in nature, thereby building each child&#39s capacity to think creatively and critically, to understand and manage emotions, and to work in a focused and willing manner.  This holistic approach to education, combined with actively reaching out to families and community, ensures that each child begins his or her path of lifelong learning on more equitable footing.
