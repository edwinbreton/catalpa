            <h3>What is the Catalpa Model?</h3>
            <p>
                The Catalpa School implementation plan is structured around four key components, all of which are 
                innovative when compared to today&#39s traditional practices. 
            </p>

            <h4>1. Artistic Integration</h4>
            <p>
                The Catalpa School will, on a daily basis, use the arts not as a supplement, but as a vehicle to 
                knowledge.  Waldorf methodology uses the arts to teach academics in a brain-based and 
                developmentally appropriate manner.  Using a curriculum rooted in the humanities, standards-based 
                academic content is taught during main lesson blocks that incorporate integrated movement, visual art, 
                storytelling or drama.  Teachers will be trained to address special needs, both academic and behavioral, 
                through therapeutic use of the arts.  The students of The Catalpa School will not learn in a fragmentary 
                manner, in deep contrast with the current &#39sit and get&#39 style of education that is repeatedly found to be 
                ineffective with the at-risk population.
            </p>

            <h4>2. Play with Social Intent</h4> 
            <p>
                Play at The Catalpa School is much more than what society generally considers.  Given time for 
                exploration and imagination, children will strengthen gross and fine motor muscles.  These times of 
                outbreath during each day are filled with opportunities that allow children to learn to resolve conflict 
                peacefully and teachers to listen to the needs of their students, guiding stories and circle activities to the 
                needs of all children in their classrooms.  Children learn early problem-solving skills by building with 
                natural materials such as tree limbs, and improve balance by crossing logs on foot.  Without a stated 
                objective, children themselves conduct science experiments with dirt and water to learn the properties 
                of solids and liquids, and they observe the weather to learn about changes in our environment.  During 
                play, experiences transition to real-life discussions of where ESL children&#39s families originated and how 
                the weather differs when they go on trips to faraway places.  Time after time, adults in education forget 
                that children truly are their own teachers.  The teacher&#39s responsibility is to allow opportunities for 
                learning, and to strategically pull knowledge out of students as it becomes appropriate for development.
            </p>

            <h4>3. Relationships as a Foundation</h4>
            <p>
                There are a variety of ways in which The Catalpa School will depend on the strength of community 
                relationships to guarantee the success of the school.
            </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Distribution of Classes: Teachers will loop, or stay, with their classes throughout the 
                    duration of their enrollment.  Preschool and Kindergarten will be independent years, 
                    followed by a grades 1-5 loop and a 6-8 loop.  Data suggests that looping saves an average 
                    of six weeks of instructional time at the beginning of each year.   This allows teachers to fully 
                    scaffold instruction and create deep, lasting relationships with each student.
                    </li>   
                    <li>Ongoing Student Participation:  Graduation does not mean the end of a student&#39s 
                    relationship with The Catalpa School.  Graduates of the school will regularly be invited to 
                    visit the community in a variety of ways, including: volunteer opportunities to tutor students 
                    after school, parent-engagement panel discussions, and teen-leadership community 
                    mentoring positions.
                    </li>
                    <li>Family and Community Investment Plan:  The Catalpa School will facilitate positive 
                    community change on a grass roots level by making school life accessible and welcoming.  
                    The Family and Community Investment Plan will assist families in in gaining resources to 
                    meet the needs of students outside school that are prerequisite to school success.  Our 
                    investment plan makes it clear that The Catalpa School approaches family services from a 
                    mindset of investment and empowerment, not charity.
